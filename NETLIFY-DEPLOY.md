## 🎯 Option 1: Drag & Drop (EASIEST!)

### Step 1: Build Your App

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with your app.

### Step 2: Go to Netlify

1. Visit: **https://app.netlify.com/drop**
2. **Sign up/Login** (use email, GitHub, or GitLab - it's free!)

### Step 3: Drag & Drop

1. Find your `dist` folder (it's in your project: `/Users/rudilouw/DEV APPS/the-bible-chat/dist`)
2. **Drag the ENTIRE `dist` folder** onto the Netlify Drop zone
3. Wait for it to upload (takes ~30 seconds)
4. You'll get a live URL instantly! 🎉

### Step 4: Add Your API Key

1. In Netlify, click on your new site
2. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
3. Click **Add a variable**
4. Add these two:
   - Name: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, Value: `AIzaSyA9FJVjmfceyyrMB7EaKmjMknkNDiqgbWo`
   - Name: `VITE_APP_PASSWORD`, Value: `Jesus`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 5: Redeploy

Since we just added environment variables:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**

**Done!** Your app is live! 🎉

## 🎯 Option 2: Deploy from GitHub (Automatic Updates)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Netlify

1. Go to **https://app.netlify.com**
2. Click **Add new site** → **Import an existing project**
3. Choose **GitHub**
4. Select your repository
5. Click **Deploy site**

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

Same as Option 1, Step 4 above.

### Step 4: Done!

Now every time you push to GitHub, Netlify automatically redeploys! 🚀
